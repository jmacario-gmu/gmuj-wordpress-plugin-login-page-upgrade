Summary: Mason WordPress plugin which implements improvements to the WordPress login page. 

Description:  

This plugin makes several changes to the Wordpress login page: 

* Modifies the style of the login page to provide Mason branding 

* Modifies the login page header link to link to an appropriate Mason URL (rather than wordpress.org) 

* Modifies the login page header text to provide an appropriate Mason-specific message 

* Modifies the default login error messages to provide less detail about the login error 

* Removes the login form ‘shake’ effect on error

Notes:

This plugin is now deprecated as it's functionality was moved into the Mason WordPress theme.
